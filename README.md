# Kernel-methods-and-gaussian-processes-applications

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with different kernel functions.

### Using Different Kernels in SVM: 
In this notebook, we explore the use of different kernel functions in SVM, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. We compare the performance of these kernels on a sample dataset and discuss the pros and cons of each.

### Demonstration of Gaussian Processes: 
In this notebook, we demonstrate the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) from Scikit-learn Gaussian Process Regression .

### Designing a Kernel and Applying it in SVM for NLP Tasks: 
In this notebook, we show how to design a custom kernel function and apply it to an SVM model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
